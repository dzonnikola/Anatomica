# Anatomica

This is a student project for learning purposes.
Anatomica is planned to be online e-commerce platform for ordering anatomic footwear. One thing that separates Anatomica from the rest of similar e-commerce platforms is that our idea is based on quick delivery of products. A quick explanation : Ordering anatomic footwear is a little complex because it takes time for your products you ordered, and when I say "takes time", it is usually a month or so. So, our idea is that when you log in to platform, you only get and offer of the best sold products based on some statistics on sales. So, you'll get access to that products and you will be able to get them much faster than some regular products. Why only best sold products? They have constant sale and production. Also, not everyone will have chance to work with this portal. Terms of sales are important also, so based on our current clients whom we work with, we will decide who will get contract to sign, so this project is closed type. You need to have credidentials to access the platform.

Tehnical things about the project : Anatomica is website with PHP used for backend, HTML/CSS/JS used for frontend. CRUD operations impemented for admin panel. There are 2 log in directions, one for admin, one for user. If admin logs in, he goes straight into admin dashboard. If user logs in, he will be directed to welcome page for user.

Project is still in development fase.
